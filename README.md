# Scene Organizer and Data Exporter

This tool is designed to help organize scenes and provide various export options. It was created by Michael Kato in 2013, taking contributions from James Kyle for FBX export functionalities.

## Features

- **Scene Management**: Organize and manage scene objects for export.
- **Animation Management**: Work with many animations in a single file. The tool saves anim ranges on the timeline so that you can have all character anims in one. The tool can then export animations by restoring the timeline at a specific point. 
- **Attribute Handling**: Get, set, edit, and delete attributes of scene objects.
- **Export Functionality**: Export scenes with various options, including moving objects to the origin before export.
